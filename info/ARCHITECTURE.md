# Architecture

This document is designed to provide an overview of Auxio's architecture and design decisions. It will be updated as Auxio changes.

## Core Facets

Auxio has a couple of core systems or concepts that should be understood when working with the codebase.

#### Package Structure

Auxio's package structure is strictly feature-oriented. For example, playback code is exclusively in the `playback` package,
and detail code is exclusively in the `detail` package. Sub-packages can be related to the code it contains, such as `detail.recycler`
for the detail UI adapters, or they can be related to a sub-feature, like `playback.queue` for the queue UI.

A full run-down of Auxio's current package structure as of the latest version is shown below.

Each package is gone over in more detail later on.

#### UI Structure

Auxio only has one activity, `MainActivity`. Do not try to add more activities to the codebase. Instead, a new UI
should be added as a new `Fragment` implementation and added to one of the two navigation graphs:

- `nav_main`: Navigation *from* `MainFragment`
- `nav_explore`: Navigation *in* `MainFragment` 

Fragments themselves are organized in order of lifecycle. So the first override would be `onCreate`, followed by
`onCreateView`, and so on. `onCreateView` is where all view instantiation and configuration takes place, and
is separated into three phases:

- Create variables [Bindings, Adapters, etc]
- Set up the UI
- Set up ViewModel instances and LiveData observers

`findViewById` is to **only** be used when interfacing with non-Auxio views. Otherwise, viewbinding should be
used in all cases. If one needs to keep track of a viewbinding outside of `onCreateView`, then one can declare
a binding `by memberBinding(BindingClass::inflate)` in order to have a binding that properly disposes itself
on lifecycle events.

At times it may be more appropriate to use a `View` instead of a full blown fragment. This is okay as long as
viewbinding is still used.

When creating a ViewHolder for a `RecyclerView`, one should use `BaseViewHolder` to standardize the binding process
and automate some code shared across all ViewHolders. The only exceptions to this case are for ViewHolders that
correspond to non-`BaseModel` data, in which a normal ViewHolder can be used instead.

Data is often bound using Binding Adapters, which are XML attributes assigned in layout files that can automatically 
display data, usually written as `app:bindingAdapterName="@{data}"`. Its recommended to use these instead of applying
the attributes directly unless absolutely necessary. Usually it's okay to apply data programmatically if you begin
to duplicate layouts simply because they apply to different data objects, such as the detail UIs.

#### Object communication

Auxio's codebase is mostly centered around 4 different types of code that communicates with each-other.

- UIs: Fragments, RecyclerView items, and Activities are part of this class. All of them should have little data logic
in them and should primarily focus on displaying information in their UIs.
- ViewModels: These usually contain data and values that a UI can display, along with doing data processing. The data
often takes the form of `MutableLiveData` or `LiveData`, which can be observed.
- Shared Objects: These are the fundamental building blocks of Auxio, and exist at the process level. These are usually
retrieved using `getInstance` or a similar function. Shared Objects should be avoided in UIs, as their volatility can
cause problems. Its better to use a ViewModel and their exposed data instead.
- Utilities: These are largely found in the `.util` and `.coil` packages, taking the form of standalone or extension
functions that can be used anywhere.

Ideally, UIs should only be talking to ViewModels, ViewModels should only be talking to the Shared Objects, and Shared Objects
should only be talking to other shared objects.  All objects can use the utility functions where appropriate.

#### Data objects

Auxio represents data in multiple ways.

`BaseModel` is the base class for most music and UI data in Auxio, with a single ID field meant to mark it as unique.

It has the following implementations:
- `Music` is a `BaseModel` that represents music. It adds a `name` field that represents the raw name of the music (from `MediaStore`).
- `MusicParent` is a type of `Music` that contains children. It adds a `resolveName` field that converts the raw `MediaStore` name
to a name that can be used in UIs.
- `Header` and `ActionHeader` are UI data objects that represent a header item. `Header` corresponds to a simple header with no action,
while `ActionHeader` corresponds to an action with a dedicated icon, such as with sorting.

Other data types represent a specific UI configuration or state:

- Sealed classes like `Sort` and `HeaderString` contain data with them that can be modified.
- Enums like `DisplayMode` and `LoopMode` only contain static data, such as a string resource.

#### Music Access

All music on a system is asynchronously loaded into the shared object `MusicStore`. Because of this, **`MusicStore` may not be available at all times**.

- ViewModels should try to await or gracefully exit the called method if `MusicStore` is not available
- In the case that a ViewModel needs a `MusicStore` instance to function, an instance can be required. This should be done sparingly.
- Other shared objects that rely on `MusicStore` [like `PlaybackStateManager`] will no-op if music is not available.

If the loading status needs to be shown in a UI, `MusicViewModel` can be used to observe the current music loader response.

#### Playback System

Auxio's playback system is somewhat unorthodox, as it avoids much of the android-provided APIs in favor of a more controllable and sensible system.
The diagram below highlights the overall structure and connections:

```
                                                                           [Requests update from]
                                                 ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
                                                 │                                                                                 │

                   │                             ├ MediaSession
                   │                             └ Player
                   │
                   └──────────────────── PlaybackViewModel  ───────────────────── UIs
                                                             [Communicates With]
```

`PlaybackStateManager` is the shared object that contains the master copy of the playback state, doing all operations on it. This object should
***NEVER*** be used in a UI, as it does not sanitize input and can cause major problems if a Volatile UI interacts with it. It's callback system
is also prone to memory leaks if not cleared when done. `PlaybackViewModel` should be used instead, as it exposes stable data and safe functions
that UIs can use to interact with the playback state.

`PlaybackService`'s job is to use the playback state to manage the ExoPlayer instance, the notification, the widget, and also modify the state depending on
system events, such as when a button is pressed on a headset. It should **never** be bound to, mostly because there is no need given that
`PlaybackViewModel` exposes the same data in a much safer fashion.

#### Data Integers

Integer representations of data/UI elements are used heavily in Auxio, primarily for efficiency.
To prevent any strange bugs, all integer representations must be unique. A table of all current integers used are shown below:

```
0xA0XX | UI Integer Space [Required by android]

0xA000 | SongViewHolder
0xA001 | AlbumViewHolder
0xA002 | ArtistViewHolder
0xA003 | GenreViewHolder
0xA004 | HeaderViewHolder
0xA005 | ActionHeaderViewHolder

0xA006 | AlbumDetailViewHolder
0xA007 | AlbumSongViewHolder
0xA008 | ArtistDetailViewHolder
0xA009 | ArtistAlbumViewHolder
0xA00A | ArtistSongViewHolder
0xA00B | GenreDetailViewHolder
0xA00C | GenreSongViewHolder

0xA00D | QueueSongViewHolder

0xA0A0 | Auxio notification code
0xA0C0 | Auxio request code

0xA1XX | Data Integer Space [Stored for IO efficency]

0xA100 | LoopMode.NONE
0xA101 | LoopMode.ALL
0xA102 | LoopMode.TRACK

0xA103 | PlaybackMode.IN_GENRE
0xA104 | PlaybackMode.IN_ARTIST
0xA105 | PlaybackMode.IN_ALBUM
0xA106 | PlaybackMode.ALL_SONGS

0xA107 | Null DisplayMode [Filter Nothing]
0xA108 | DisplayMode.SHOW_GENRES
0xA109 | DisplayMode.SHOW_ARTISTS
0xA10A | DisplayMode.SHOW_ALBUMS
0xA10B | DisplayMode.SHOW_SONGS

0xA10C | Sort.Name
0xA10D | Sort.Artist
0xA10E | Sort.Album
0xA10F | Sort.Year
```

Some datatypes [like `Tab` and `Sort`] have even more fine-grained integer representations for other data. More information can be found in
the documentation for these datatypes.

## Package-by-package rundown

#### `org.oxycblt.auxio`

This is the root package and contains the application instance and the landing UIs. This should be kept sparse with most other code being placed
into a package.

#### `.accent`

This package is responsible for Auxio's color schemes, internally known as accents due to legacy code.
It contains an object that represents the attributes of an accent, but this should be avoided in favor of
resolving color attributes directly, such as `colorPrimary`. This package also contains the UIs for picking
an accent.

#### `.coil`

[Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil) is the image loader used by Auxio. All image loading is done through these four functions/binding adapters:

- `app:albumArt`: Binding Adapter that will load the cover art for a song or album
- `app:artistImage`: Binding Adapter that will load the artist image
- `app:genreImage`: Binding Adapter that will load the genre image
- `loadBitmap`: Function that will take a song and return a bitmap, this should not be used in anything UI related, that is what the binding adapters above are for.

This should be enough to cover most use cases in Auxio.

Internally, multiple fetchers are provided to transform `Music` instances into images. All of these fetchers inherit `AuxioFetcher`, which implements
the necessary methods for loading album artwork and creating the mosaics shown in artist/genre images.

#### `.detail`

Contains all the detail UIs for some data types in Auxio. All detail user interfaces share the same base layout (A Single RecyclerView) and
only change the adapter/data being used. The adapters display both the header with information and the child items of the item itself, usually
with a data list similar to this:

`Item being displayed | Header Item | Child Item | Child Item | Child Item...`

Each adapter instance also handles the highlighting of the currently playing item in the detail menu.

`DetailViewModel` acts as the holder for the currently displaying items, along with having the `navToItem` LiveData that coordinates menu/playback
navigation [Such as when a user presses "Go to artist"]

#### `.excluded`

This package is responsible for the excluded directory system. It contains the database of excluded directories and the dialog that appears when
editing them.

**Note:** Certain naming in this package might not line up with the current name of the package. This is because updating those names would break
compatibility with previous versions of Auxio.

#### `.home`

This package contains the components for the "home" UI in Auxio, or the UI that the user first sees when they open the app.

- The base package contains the top-level components that manage the FloatingActionButton, AppBar, and ViewPager instances.
- The `fastscroll` package contains the fast scroll component used in each list of music
- The `list` package contains the individual fragments for each list of music. These are all placed in the top-level ViewPager instance.
- The `tabs` package contains the data representation of an individual library tab and the UIs for editing them.

#### `.music`

This package contains all `BaseModel` implementations and the music loading implementation. This also includes `Header`/`ActionHeader`, as those
data objects have to inherit `BaseModel` so that they can be placed alongside `Music` instances in `RecyclerView` instances.

#### `.playback`

This module not only contains the playback system described above, but also multiple other components:

- `queue` contains the Queue UI and it's fancy item transitions
- `state` contains the core playback state and persistence system
- `system` contains the system-facing playback system

The most important part of this module is `PlaybackLayout`, which is a custom `ViewGroup` that implements the playback bar and it's ability to
slide up into the full playback view. `MainFragment` controls this `ViewGroup`.

#### `.search`

Package for Auxio's search functionality, `SearchViewHolder` handles the data results and filtering while `SearchFragment`/`SearchAdapter` handles the
display of the results and user input.

#### `.settings`

The settings system is primarily based off of `SettingsManager`, a wrapper around `SharedPreferences`. This allows settings to be read/written in a
much simpler/safer manner and without a context being needed. The Settings UI is largely contained in `SettingsListFragment`, while the `pref`
sub-package contains `IntListPreference`, which allows Auxio's integer representations to be used with the preference UI. The about dialog
also resides in this package.

#### `.ui`

Shared views and view configuration models. This contains:

- Customized views such as `EdgeAppBarLayout` and `EdgeRecyclerView`, which add some extra functionality not provided by default
- Configuration models like `DisplayMode` and `Sort`, which are used in many places but aren't tied to a specific feature.
- `newMenu` and `ActionMenu`, which automates menu creation for most data types
- `memberBinding` and `MemberBinder`, which allows for ViewBindings to be used as a member variable without memory leaks or nullability issues.

#### `.util`

Shared utilities. This is primarily for QoL when developing Auxio. Documentation is provided on each method.

#### `.widgets`

This package contains Auxio's AppWidget implementation, which deviates from other AppWidget implementations by packing multiple
different layouts into a single widget and then switching between them depending on the widget size.

When `WidgetProvider` creates a layout, it first turns the `PlaybackStateManager` instance into a `WidgetState`, which is
an immutable version of the playback state that negates some of the problems with using a shared object here. It then picks
a layout [e.g "Form"] depending on its current dimensions and applies the `WidgetState` object to that.

**Note:** The AppWidget implementation violates UI conventions by directly interfacing with coil and `PlaybackStateManager`.
This is required due to `RemoteView` limitations.
